# Animal-skin-disease-classification
I have used a CNN-based deep learning model to extract features and classify the image based on the skin disease. In order to train the model, there was no dataset available, so I collected images of a particular disease of the animals and created my own dataset. I have also augmented the data in order to train the model for different situations. Used CNN (Sequential and functional API) for image Processing.The accuracy of the model is around 90 percent
